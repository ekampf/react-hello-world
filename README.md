# react-hello-world

This is my boilerplate template for React projects.
It comes in 3 flavors (branches):
* master - A basic minimal React template
* feature/bootstrap - basic + Twitter Bootstrap integration
* feature/bourbon_neat - basic + Bourbon + Neat
* feature/Redux - basic + Redux + simple TodoMVC app
